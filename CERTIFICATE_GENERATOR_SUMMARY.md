# Certificate Generator Component - Complete Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully developed a clean, professional certificate generation component based on the images you provided. The component displays a live certificate template with three input fields and generates a certificate image when all inputs are filled.

## What Was Created

### 1. Main Component: `CertificateGenerator`

- **Location**: `src/components/CertificateGenerator/CertificateGenerator.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Live certificate template preview
  - Searchable student selection dropdown
  - Searchable course selection dropdown (in Arabic)
  - Date picker input
  - Real-time certificate updates
  - Image generation using html2canvas
  - API integration for sending generated certificates

### 2. Styling: `CertificateGenerator.module.scss`

- **Location**: `src/components/CertificateGenerator/CertificateGenerator.module.scss`
- **Features**:
  - Professional certificate design matching your template
  - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
  - Arabic and English text support
  - Clean, modern input form design
  - Subtle background patterns and graphics

### 3. Updated Components

- **DatePicker**: Enhanced to accept controlled props
- **Certificates Page**: Updated to use the new component

### 4. API Examples

- **Node.js/Express**: Complete backend implementation
- **Python/FastAPI**: Alternative backend implementation
- **Package.json**: Dependencies for the API

## Key Features

### ✅ Live Certificate Preview

- Shows the certificate template exactly as it will appear
- Updates in real-time as you fill in the inputs
- Professional design matching your official certificate

### ✅ Three Input Fields

1. **Student Selection**: Searchable dropdown with all students
2. **Course Selection**: Searchable dropdown with training names in Arabic
3. **Date Selection**: Calendar picker for the certificate date

### ✅ Dynamic Content

- Student name appears in the certificate template
- Course name appears in the certificate template
- Date appears in the certificate template
- All text is properly formatted in Arabic

### ✅ Image Generation

- Converts the certificate to a high-quality PNG image
- Uses html2canvas for reliable conversion
- Sends the image to your API endpoint

### ✅ Form Validation

- "Create Certificate" button is only enabled when all fields are filled
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Clean user experience

## How It Works

1. **Component Mounts**: Fetches students and courses from your GraphQL API
2. **User Inputs**: User selects student, course, and date
3. **Live Preview**: Certificate template updates in real-time
4. **Validation**: Button becomes enabled when all fields are complete
5. **Generation**: Clicking the button generates an image using html2canvas
6. **API Call**: Sends the image to `/api/certificates/generate` endpoint
7. **Success**: Certificate is processed and stored

## API Endpoint

The component sends data to: `POST /api/certificates/generate`

**Request Format**:

```javascript
FormData {
  certificate: Blob (PNG image),
  studentId: string,
  courseId: string,
  date: string
}
```

**Response Format**:

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  message: "Certificate generated successfully",
  data: {
    certificateId: string,
    imageUrl: string,
    studentId: string,
    courseId: string,
    date: string,
    generatedAt: string
  }
}
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Dependencies

The component requires `html2canvas` which has been installed:

```bash
npm install html2canvas
```

### 2. Usage

Simply import and use the component:

```tsx
import CertificateGenerator from "./components/CertificateGenerator";

function App() {
  return <CertificateGenerator />;
}
```

### 3. Backend Setup

To run the example API:

```bash
cd api-examples
npm install
npm start
```
