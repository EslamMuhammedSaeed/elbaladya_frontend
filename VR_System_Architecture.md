# VR Training System Architecture Diagram

## System Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture for a distributed VR training platform with offline-first capabilities, network-aware data synchronization, and centralized monitoring.

## Architecture Components

### 1. External Network (Internet)

- Public access point for VPN connections
- External users access through secure VPN gateway

### 2. Organization Network (Internal)

- **DMZ/Public Zone**: Load balancer, API gateway, VPN gateway, firewall, WAF
- **Application Layer**: Backend services and frontend platform
- **Data Layer**: Primary database, cache layer, search engine, file storage, backup
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Container orchestration, service mesh, monitoring, logging, security

### 3. Local Network (VR Training Area)

- **VR Controller App**: Device discovery, training control, real-time monitoring, offline storage, network detection
- **VR Devices**: Training engine, sensor integration, real-time data collection, offline storage, network detection

## Data Flow

1. **Online Mode**: VR Device → WiFi → VR Controller → WiFi → Backend → Database
2. **Offline Mode**: Data stored locally in SQLite/IndexedDB
3. **Sync Mode**: Local storage → Sync engine → Conflict resolution → Backend → Database

## Key Features

- Offline-first architecture with local data storage
- Network-aware synchronization
- Real-time monitoring and analytics
- Multi-layered security
- Scalable microservices architecture
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Python microservices
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with TypeScript
- **VR Apps**: Unity/Unreal Engine
- **Controller App**: React Native/Flutter
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL with Redis cache
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, monitoring stack
